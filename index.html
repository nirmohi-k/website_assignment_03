        <p>Hi! I'm Nirmohi.</p>
        <p>
          I am a licensed architect and designer working at the intersection of
          <strong>urbanism, climate change, and equity</strong>. My
          work focuses on spatial justice, housing studies, and the urban
          commons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am studying at MS Advanced Urban Design at Cornell University in New York. My previous projects have examined
          <strong>urban flooding, density, and sea-level rise</strong> in
          Mumbai, and I have worked with local communities and policymakers to
          propose interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional experience includes working with <strong><a href="https://www.sjkarchitects.com/">SJK
          Architects</a></strong> on sustainability and material lifecycle research
          and contributing to designing adaptive urban spaces. With a keen interest in research and writing, I have also been
          featured in <em>Unbuilt 2.0: Architecture of the Future Collectives</em>, <em>Mid-Day</em> and <em>Citizen Matters</em> for my
          research on climate change and mapping methodologies.

          <p class="project-description">
            As published in <strong>Unbuilt 2.0</strong>, the design creates
            fantastical punctuations in the ‘traditional’ framework of the
            building. It metaphorically reifies the notion of ‘play’, of a parallel
            liberalisation from the conventional and the older zeitgeist. The
            ambition is to provoke, evoke, to create a self-referential idea that
            breaks away from the known and the latent. Instead of formal and
            material aspects, it focuses on a choreography of experiences that
            bring in this point of view.

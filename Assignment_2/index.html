      </p>
      <p class="assignment-description">
        This analysis examines the correlation between subway ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic and the median income of households in different neighborhoods. By comparing the number of people using subway stations with income levels, the study highlights disparities in transit dependency, economic resilience, and mobility patterns during the crisis. The findings provide insights into how lower-income communities were more reliant on public transportation despite health risks, while higher-income areas saw steeper declines in ridership due to remote work flexibility and alternative travel options.
